1. introduce flask-restful
    quickly building REST APIs
2. introduce flask-restless
     provides simple generation of ReSTful APIs for database models
     defined using SQLAlchemy (or Flask-SQLAlchemy). The generated APIs
     send and receive messages in JSON format.
3. flask.views
    based on classes instead of functions. The main intention is that
    you can replace parts of the implementations and this way
    have customizable pluggable views
    execute a different function for each HTTP method.
    With the flask.views.MethodView you can easily do that.
    Each HTTP method maps to a function with the same name (just in lowercase)
3. complete flaks-restless, use wtforms-alchemy
# 4. maybe plus flask-principal, wtforms, blueprint
5. demo is needed
